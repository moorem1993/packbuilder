            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="{% url 'mypacks' %}" class="link-primary">My Packs</a>
                    - This is where you can see all of your existing packs, or create a new pack for upcoming trips.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="{% url 'gearlocker' %}" class="link-primary">Gear Locker</a>
                    - You can take a look at all of your existing gear in your gear locker. 
                    You can add new gear, edit existing gear, or delete gear you no longer need.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pack View - 
                    This lets you take a look at the contents of a pack. 
                    You can add new gear, add gear from your gear locker, remove gear from the pack, or delete a piece of gear entirely. 
                    There's also a handy plot at the top of the page that shows you a breakdown of your gear by category.</li>
